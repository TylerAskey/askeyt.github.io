        <figcaption>I am Tyler Askey. I'm 18 years old soon to be 19. I'm in college taking a class called Digital systems fundementals that teaches how to create websites and helps to understand code better. When it comes to  me I'm a person who can learn by experimenting so coding is fun but also at the same time frustrating, because there would be one mistake that breaks everything or I'm unable to understand what I did wrong.</figcaption>
